# UndertaleFX

UndertaleFX is a Java project aimed at emulating the battle mode of the popular game Undertale using JavaFX. This project is still in development but already showcases impressive features, including a functional menu with buttons reminiscent of Undertale's "FIGHT," "ACT," "ITEM," and "MERCY" options. 

While enemies themselves are still experimental, it is already possible to spare them by acting in specific ways. The implementation allows for easy creation of enemies, thanks to Java being OOP.

Additionally, UndertaleFX includes a developer mode. In this mode, you can access additional functionality that aids in testing and development, like increasing/decreasing the players level, adding / removing enemies and a lot more.

Original sounds, as well as music have also been added already . So far it plays exactly like Undertale, whilst also supporting some other keys one might prefer over the arrow keys for control over the player.

## UndertaleFX is inspired by Toby Fox's game Undertale. I would like to acknowledge Toby Fox and the entire Undertale development team for creating such a fantastic game that serves as the foundation for this project. Sprites, sounds and music have been taken from Undertale to support this project, as the goal is to increase my programming skill and Java/JavaFX knowledge.
